# Beeline Admin UI
A web interface for transport operators on Beeline. 

This repository holds the codebase for the web application used by transport operators to track and manage their route logistics as well as ticket bookings. It talks to the backend whose code can be found at datagovsg/beeline-server.

This app was initially written in Angular, but parts of it are slowly migrated over to Vue.js.
